## Overview

LaunchControl is a CoreMIDI-based framework for managing communication between your app and MIDI hardware, with specific support for Novation Launchpads and similar devices.

It provides a streamlined interface for discovering endpoints, establishing connections, and sending or receiving MIDI messagesâ€”all with performance and reliability suitable for real-time, latency-sensitive environments.

Designed with both developers and performers in mind, LaunchControl includes:

- Automatic discovery of MIDI input and output devices
- Efficient message transmission with packet size validation and structured logging
- Live monitoring of connection changes, enabling dynamic responses to device attachment or removal
- Integrated support for displaying hex dumps for inspection and debugging

LaunchControl abstracts the complexities of CoreMIDI, helping you focus on your app's creative functionality.
