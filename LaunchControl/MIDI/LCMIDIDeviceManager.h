/// A MIDI device manager based on CoreMIDI, designed to facilitate communication with connected MIDI hardware.
///
/// `LCMIDIDeviceManager` provides a centralized interface for interacting with CoreMIDI endpoints.
/// It supports device enumeration, name-to-endpoint resolution, inbound message reception, and outbound data transmission.
/// This manager abstracts the CoreMIDI C APIs into an Objective-C interface suitable for both Objective-C and Swift applications.
@interface LCMIDIDeviceManager : NSObject

/// An array of connected and available output device names currently visible to the system.
///
/// This array is updated automatically after invoking ``start``, ``rescanDevices``,
/// or when system MIDI notifications indicate device connections or disconnections.
@property (nonatomic, readonly) NSArray<NSString *> *connectedDevices;

/// Maximum allowed size in bytes for a single MIDI packet data message.
/// Messages larger than this will be rejected and logged as warnings.
/// Default is 4096 bytes.
